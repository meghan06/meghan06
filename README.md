Greetings!

My name is Ryan, and I'm a proficient software developer who is highly passionate about everything related to computers, especially the art of breaking them. At present, I'm working on a dedicated GitHub repository, which goes by the name of ChromebookOSX. The main objective of this repository is to make Chromebooks functional with the macOS operating system, which will further enhance their capabilities and increase their user base.

Apart from my ongoing work, I'm also currently engaged in expanding my knowledge and honing my skills in various fields. For instance, I'm actively learning the intricacies of penetration testing, which is a highly specialized area of cybersecurity, as well as delving deeper into the world of C++, an object-oriented programming language.

As much as I love exploring new domains and developing innovative projects, there are times when I require a helping hand. One such instance is in fixing the heap of bugs in ChromebookOSX, which is currently impeding its progress. Hence, I would be more than grateful if someone could lend me a hand in this endeavor. Moreover, I want to make it known that my preferred pronouns are he/him.

Currently, I'm pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, and I'm continually on the lookout for opportunities to broaden my knowledge through internships, projects, and other challenging positions. If you're interested in collaborating with me or want to know more about my past experiences and achievements, please do visit my blog posts or feel free to reach out to me. I would be more than happy to connect with like-minded individuals and engage in discussions.
