Hey there!

I'm a software developer who's passionate about computers, especially tinkering with them. Right now, I'm working on a project called ChromebookOSX on GitHub. The goal of this project is to make Chromebooks work with macOS, making them more versatile and accessible.

Aside from that, I'm always trying to expand my skills and knowledge. I'm currently exploring penetration testing, a specialized field of cybersecurity, and diving deeper into Python, an object-oriented programming language.

While I love exploring new things and working on innovative projects, sometimes I need a little help. In particular, I could use some assistance fixing the bugs in ChromebookOSX that are holding it back. If you're interested in helping out, I would greatly appreciate it! Also, just FYI, my pronouns are he/him.

I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, and I'm always on the lookout for opportunities to learn and grow through internships, projects, and challenging roles. If you're interested in collaborating or want to learn more about my experiences and achievements, feel free to check out my blog or get in touch with me. I'm always happy to connect with like-minded folks and chat.
